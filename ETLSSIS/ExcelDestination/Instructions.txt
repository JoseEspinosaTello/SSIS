This folder is used as the excel source destination for the dataflow task. This will be the recently added rows to the database.
This exel file must always have the name "RecentlyLoaded" and the file must always be empty.
Once the SSIS dataflow task loads data to the file from the database the following script tasks will copy and archive the report, and finally will reset the "RecentlyLoaded" file with a clean unused file.
